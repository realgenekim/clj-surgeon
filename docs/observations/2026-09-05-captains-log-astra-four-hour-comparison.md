# Captain’s log — Astra four-hour comparison block

## 2026-09-05T14:54Z — Gene directive

Gene confirmed the telemetry blind spot: ten public `helper_extraction` calls had produced zero service events. He assigned Astra four hours to repair that route and pursue a fair, replicated comparison including orientation and proof costs.

The cause is in the public handler: `handle-helper-extraction` routed directly to `helper-extraction/execute!` and never used the shared `record-call!` seam. Added content-free `helper_extraction` request/outcome shaping and public `tool.call` emission for success and routing refusal. The public wire witness now observes one service event for a real helper call. Focused helper lane: 48 tests, 1,159 assertions, zero failures. Commits: `68516776` implementation; `7f3605fa` public telemetry witness.

The comparison contract is frozen in `2026-09-05-astra-fair-comparison-prereg.md`: six accepted native controls per model, mirrored serial order, attested subjects, startup-inclusive primary wall, symmetric orientation/proof burden, independent acceptance, blind judges, and retained failures. `make anvil-arms-self-test` passed 389/389; this is apparatus evidence only. No timed comparison arm has been accepted yet.
