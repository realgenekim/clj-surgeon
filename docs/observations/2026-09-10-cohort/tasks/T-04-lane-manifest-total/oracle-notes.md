# Oracle notes — T-04-lane-manifest-total
### Several correct spellings

The comment's wording is free; it must mention the new total so the pin carries
its reason (the file's own stated convention). The assertion's message string
is free.

### Scope

Exactly one owner changes. The three assertions beside it — the round-one
floor, the adopted-tests pin and the closing arithmetic — are explicitly out of
scope and are asserted unchanged. `wrong-output.clj` is the plausible failure:
the total is corrected and the adopted pin is silently dragged along with it.

### Gate caveat

`total` is computed from the whole test corpus at `:sha`, so this task's gate
verdict is a property of files the task does not touch. Record the baseline
first; see `:gate-note` in `meta.edn`.


## How this oracle decides

Two hashers that share no code:

1. **Semantics** — `clj-kondo --lint <file> --config '{:analysis true :output
   {:format :edn}}'`, read through `curation/kondo_edn.py`. Requires, aliases,
   defined vars and resolved var usages come from the analyzer's own name
   resolution, plus fixed-string assertions about the specific thing asked for.
   Any error-level finding other than `namespace-name-mismatch` (which only
   fires because the proof harness lints the file outside its repository) is a
   failure on its own.
2. **Preservation** — `curation/formhash.py`, a hand-written bracket-matching
   tokenizer. It hashes every top-level form's raw bytes, the raw bytes of the
   gap BEFORE each form, and each form's ordinal position. It uses no Clojure
   reader, so it cannot share a failure mode with rewrite-clj or edamame. A
   candidate that does not bracket-match is red, not unknown.

Only the owners named in `preserve_only` may differ; everything else must be
byte-identical, in the same order, with the same text between forms.

## What this oracle deliberately does NOT establish

It does not run the repository's tests. `meta.edn` names the repository's own
narrowest gate; the harness must run that separately, and must first record the
gate's verdict on the UNTOUCHED tree at `:sha` as a baseline (see
`:gate-note`). It does not check any file other than the one named — the
harness's own diff of the worktree owns that.

## Apparatus note

`/var/tmp/forge/cohort-fx/apparatus/oracle-lib.sh` and `apparatus/task-schema.md`
did not exist when these tasks were curated, so the oracle is the protocol's
self-contained fallback, with the shared helpers in
`/var/tmp/forge/cohort-fx/curation/oracle-lib.sh`. If the apparatus later
publishes an `oracle-lib.sh` with the same entry points, change the
`ORACLE_LIB` line at the top of `oracle.sh`; nothing else in the task depends
on it.
